# Populous Map Generator

Populous Map Generator is a reimplementation of TedTycoon's RMS Edit. It includes new commands and redesigned user interface which supports interactive map editing. The basic usage is the same as the original; however, most of the original commands are incompatible due to different parameters.

The latest version is available [here](https://github.com/coota11/popgen/releases).

## Basic Usage

1. Write a script and press the **Compile** button.
2. On the menu, click **View** > **Map**.
3. Press the **Generate** button.

See the script reference and tutorials in `docs`. You can run the example scripts in `examples`.
